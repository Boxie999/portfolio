# portfolio
This is my first portfolio website
I used the skills that I've learned at bootcamp this week.
I created the nav bar and the footer individually, but the two main sections of the page, "About Me" and "Work" is a grid. I nested a flexbox in the first grid item "About Me" and I nested another grid in the "Work" section. 
- When the page is loaded, it represents my name, a photo of me, a sections about me and my work and how to contact me. If you click on "e-mail", it opens a new e-mail window addressed to me.
- When one of the links in the navigation bar is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- The section about my work contains titled images of my applications. If you click on the first two images, it open a new tab with the deployed applications of the pre homework challenge and week 1 challenge. I used placeholder images for the rest, because I don't have enough deployed applications yet.
- In the "Work" section, the image of the first application is larger in size. I achieved this with grid-template-areas.
- When the page is resized or wieved on various screens and devices, then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport. I did this with media queries.
